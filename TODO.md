# The Official To-Do List
## High priority
- [ ] Some vanilla recipes modified to have a "is this feature not enabled" condition keep it after a mod unload
- [ ] Re-implement female leg textures for armor after [IbanPlay's tMod fix](https://github.com/IbanPlay/tModLoader/commit/67368d4796a38f83e314db31130e0354fba59ab1) is merged and in stable
## Normal priority
- [ ] `ShardRecipeHandler.cs` should be broken into multiple files, maybe even a `Recipes` subdirectory?
- [ ] Various Vanities content should be configurable
- [ ] Add an option to swap the drop conditions for the Gravity Globe and the Soaring Insignia

- [ ] Pre-Hardmode ore variants can be converted at an Alchemy Table, Hardmode ore variants at a Lihzahrd Altar (the Golem summoning tile)
