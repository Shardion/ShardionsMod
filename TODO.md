# The Official To-Do List
## High priority
- [ ] Some vanilla recipes modified to have a "is this feature not enabled" condition keep it after a mod unload
- [ ] Re-implement female leg textures for armor after [IbanPlay's tMod fix](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/pull/2277) is merged and in stable
## Normal priority
- [ ] Add an option to swap the drop conditions for the Gravity Globe and the Soaring Insignia 
- [ ] ![lol](https://github.com/Shardion/ShardionsMod/blob/master/Screenshots/TaterBlight_Telling_Me_To_Make_Male_Legs_Sprites.png?raw=true)
- [ ] Pre-Hardmode ore variants can be converted at an Alchemy Table, Hardmode ore variants at a Lihzahrd Altar (the Golem summoning tile)
- [ ] Extractinator only gives the ore variants you did not get in your world, and gives coins significantly less often
- [ ] Prismatic Dye needs a sprite, and a rename since its current name conflicts with a 1.4 item
## Low priority
- [ ] Various Vanities content should be configurable
- [ ] Characters named after mod developers spawn with their corresponding developer vanity set
## ["Plant priority"](https://github.com/Shardion/ShardionsMod/blob/master/Screenshots/Plant_Telling_Me_To_Make_Him_A_ToDo_List_Priority.png?raw=true)
- [ ] Implement the Magiluminescence movement speed nerf
## Done
- [X] `ShardRecipeHandler.cs` should be broken into multiple files, maybe even a `Recipes` subdirectory?
