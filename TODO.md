# The Official To-Do List
## High priority
- [ ] Some vanilla recipes modified to have a "is this feature not enabled" condition keep it after a mod unload
- [ ] Re-implement female leg textures for armor after [IbanPlay's tMod fix](https://github.com/IbanPlay/tModLoader/commit/67368d4796a38f83e314db31130e0354fba59ab1) is merged and in stable
## Normal priority
- [ ] `ShardRecipeHandler.cs` should be broken into multiple files, maybe even a `Recipes` subdirectory?
