Shardion's Mod is a modular, configurable mod for minor enhancements to Terraria.
Currently, it includes three "modules":
Various Vanities adds new vanity items and quality-of-life features surrounding vanity items.
Unnamed Quality-of-Life module adds many quality-of-life features, such as crate upgrading/downgrading and gem conversion.
Unnamed balancing module attempts to correct issues in the game's balancing, by doing things like swapping the Gravity Globe and Soaring Insignia.

Psst! Developers! Artists!
tModReader is set to include all resources, sprite authoring files and source code.
The mod's also open source at GitHub (it's linked in our Discord server's releases channel).
Check it out! There's lots of cool stuff going on behind the scenes (custom item classes, item class reuse for many similar items, autogenerated tooltips, separate assets folder, etc).
